## About The JavaScript Workshop

[The JavaScript Workshop](https://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Workshop-Interactive-Approach-Learning-ebook/dp/B0824584WF/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The%20JavaScript%20Workshop&qid=1611056880&sr=8-1&utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=Repository&utm_campaign=9781838641917&utm_term=JavaScript&utm_content=The%20JavaScript%20Workshop) is a definitive guide to learning JavaScript in a practical way. Starting with JavaScript's core syntax and structure, the book gradually builds up to more advanced concepts like server-side development and functional programming. With this book, you'll gain the confidence to tackle any real-world JavaScript challenge.

## I am looking forward to learning

- Write clean, maintainable and eloquent JavaScript code
- Build websites using plain JS and various frameworks and libraries
- Simplify your workflow with package managers such as Gulp and Grunt
- Use Node.js to build server-side JavaScript applications
- Improve the functionality of your applications with browser APIs
- Implement asynchronous programming to build apps that can multitask
